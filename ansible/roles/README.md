Roles: Mostly aspirational and under construction. Don't expect any of this to work just yet, but feel free to jump in if you want to help. 
Placed here mostly as a placeholder for when I forget what I was doing here last. 
 The plan here is to break out the playbooks into roles so that each build can be abstracted out a bit more. 

You should, for example, just be able to ask for the software stack for a Ubiquity or Turtlebot-like robot to be built and not have to worry about which playbook you run in what order. This will also allow for abstraction for tests.
