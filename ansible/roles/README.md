Roles: Currently aspirational. The plan here is to break out the playbooks into roles so that each build can be 
abstracted out a bit more. 

You should, for example, just be able to ask for the software stack for a Ubiquity or Turtlebot-like robot to be built and not have to worry about which playbook you run in what order. This will also allow for abstraction for tests.
