Laniakea AKA "Turtle Beach", where turtles and robots are hatched.
This is a collection of Ansible and Fabric scripts & playbooks for building the 
Ubiquity ROS image described at the [Ubiquity Robots Download and Install Guide](https://github.com/UbiquityRobotics/ubiquity_main/blob/master/Doc_Downloading_and_Installing_the_Ubiquity_Ubuntu_ROS_Kernel_Image.md)

Here's what does what so far:

* make_sd.yml
   * Makes a ready-to-run SD card using the Ubiquity image from [Ubiquity Robots](http://ubiquityrobotics). This will get you an Ubuntu 14.04 "Trusty" server image running ROS Indigo Igloo
* newbiquity.yml
   * Post-boot Ansible provisioning playbook to finish up package installs and config tweaks on the image generated by ``make_sd.yml``
* bv80.yml
   * Post-boot Ansible provisioning playbook to add packages & configs for the SVROS BV80 BotVac

These should mostly work, although the make_sd.yml has received the brunt of hacking and testing. Please send pull requests, comments, bug reports, etc.
